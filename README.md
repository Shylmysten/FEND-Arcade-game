# (FEND) Arcade-Game Project
*by **Tony Boswell***


## Forward
The task was to recreate a classic arcade game. I utilized the starter project code that Udacity provided in the  [art assets and game engine](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) from thier repository. My job was to add the player characters and enemies using classes and prototype inheritances.

I converted this static project into an interactive game, following [the Guidelines in the project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.242571394.1230547285.1451946706#!/rubrics/15/view) to the best of my ability, and the detailed instructions on how to get started, in this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

I took a few liberties at improvisation by not only adding a score and visual representation of lives, but also extra gems and keys, and I even added a heart that gives extra lives instead of points. I added some peppy background music and sound effects for extra lives, key and gem pickups, as well as collisions, which seemed to me, to make the game a little funner to play.

## How To Play

Simply point your browser to https://shylmysten.github.io/FEND-Arcade-game/
or clone this repository: https://github.com/Shylmysten/FEND-Arcade-game.git
or you can download the entire game to your computer in a [zip file](https://github.com/Shylmysten/FEND-Arcade-game/archive/master.zip). Unzip the contents and navigate to the directory you unzipped the file in, and open the index.html file in your browser

 - When the page finishes loading, the game is ready to play
 - The object is to reach the water without being hit by any bugs.
 - Each collision costs 1 life
 - Along the way there are Gems and Keys you can collect that will give you extra points.
 - Gems are worth 250 points, Keys are worth 750, and reaching the water gives you 1000 points
 - You don't earn points for collecting hearts, but they will give you extra lives!!!
 - Each time you reach the water, the game's difficulty level increases with more bugs to avoid.
 - You can mute and unmute the game's background music, by clicking the speaker icon in the top right corner.  

**I hope you have as much fun playing as I did working on this project!**
